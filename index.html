        <p class="lead mb-4">A dedicated, bilingual, Business Marketing leader who undertakes complex assignments, meets tight deadlines, and delivers superior performance. With a bachelor‚Äôs degree in International Management and Marketing, I contribute professional experience to developing research and marketing for financial solutions to various objectives. As a current intern for Warner Bros. Entertainment, I am exposed to all facets of the Business Resources and Systems department, which is responsible for increasing film revenues and cost controls. I have a strong knowledge and proficiency with Flash, PhotoShop, and Action Script. Due to my experiences in working a minimum wage job and marketing internships, I understand the skills it takes to work in a professional setting. My goal at Buzzfeed is to expand my knowledge and growth as a marketing businesswomen, increase engagement, and create content that will inspire younger generations.Futhermore, I have a good eye for design and typographical layout. I possess exemplary organizational skills and offering 3+ years of experience managing an administrative team within a work environment with competing demands and heavy workload. I am presently looking for a business marketing position at Buzzfeed to create videos and work on graphic design to promote on social media platforms. I have experience in conducting in-depth market research, creating distinguished marketing campaigns, and brand management services. 
With various leadership roles in college, I know what it takes to be a leader and to take intiative in projects. I am very organized and have great time management. I have strong and verbal communication skills. Additionally, I can demonstrate problem solving and interpersonal skills to create long-lasting relationships. During my time as a Social Media Assistant for LifeAtUCR, I have created many relationships within the UCR community and developed content for various social media platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. I specialized in designing and creating content for the Instagram stories and hosting giveaways that increased engagement. LifeAtUCR was a useful resource in helping students remain updated with the school campus and organizations. I also utilized Lightroom and various models of cameras to capture videos and photos for Instagram. 
In my previous works, I am have been recognized for producing elite quality content to increase rankings, engagement, and conversion. I seek to maximize opportunities and optimize business performance. With a strong passion in brand building, I have conducted market research to leverage customer insight and creative positioning for all brands. I would like to work at Buzzfeed because as a prime example of Gen Z, I know the ‚Äúlikes‚Äù and ‚Äúdislikes‚Äù of the common Gen Z individual. I want to represent the Gen Z population and gravitate towards that particular group because they are the primary viewers of Buzzfeed. I also enjoy pop culture and I believe that Buzzfeed is the place for me to combine my passions into a workspace. I am trained to focus on continuous improvement and quality to develop my future career in a dynamic and commercial environment. My goal is to strive to contribute creativity and brainstorming skills to meet the demanding expectations of companies and clients with effective marketing strategies.
